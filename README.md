# E3SM AI Platform

E3SM AI Platform is the provider-independent backend prototype for **E3SM Compass**, a chat application that answers E3SM questions using a curated documentation corpus.

Answers include citations and source provenance. When the available evidence is insufficient, the application explicitly says so.

> [!NOTE]
> This prototype is actively evolving as project needs and evaluation findings inform its scope and design. It is not yet a complete E3SM documentation service or a production operational assistant.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Node.js 22 and npm

### Start the application

From the repository root, install dependencies, configure the backend environment, and start the API:

```bash
make sync
make backend-env
make backend-start
```

In a second terminal, start the web client:

```bash
make frontend-start
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite.

To query the API directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"question":"How do I choose an E3SM compset?"}'
```

After dependencies are installed, the default configuration runs and tests locally without proprietary services or external network requests. It uses the packaged corpus, lexical retrieval, and deterministic response generation.

`make backend-env` creates `backend/.env` from `backend/.env.example` when it
does not already exist. It never overwrites an existing local configuration.

See [Developer setup](docs/dev/setup.md) for optional retrieval modes and LLM provider configuration (LivAI at LLNL, Argo at ANL).

## Features

### E3SM Compass frontend

- **Chat interface:** React/TypeScript UI with loading and error states.
- **Answer inspection:** Citations, expandable evidence, and route/source debugging.

### Backend and inference

- **Query API:** FastAPI `POST /query` endpoint with deterministic routing.
- **Response generation:** Deterministic generation by default and as a fallback, with optional backend-only LLM providers: LivAI (LLNL) through PydanticAI, or Argo (ANL) through its gateway API.
- **Insufficient-evidence handling:** Explicit responses when the available evidence cannot support an answer.
- **Extensible interfaces:** Provider-independent retrieval and generation, with extension points for future web and operational connectors. Live connectors are not bundled.

### Knowledge and retrieval

- **Curated corpus:** 31 entries covering the E3SM User Guide, Running E3SM, EAM, EAMxx, ELM, Diagnostics, and E3SM-Unified.
- **Retrieval modes:** Deterministic lexical retrieval by default, with optional semantic and hybrid modes using LlamaIndex and Hugging Face embeddings.
- **Evidence checks:** Relevance filtering, source provenance, and citations.

### Evaluation and observability

- **Behavior validation:** Deterministic pytest fixtures check routing, evidence, and citations.
- **Request monitoring:** Structured JSON logs, request IDs, and OpenTelemetry tracing with privacy-preserving defaults.
- **Local trace inspection:** Optional OpenTelemetry Collector and Jaeger stack.

## How it works

The frontend sends questions to `POST /query`. During development, Vite proxies these requests to the backend.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    UI["E3SM Compass frontend"] -->|POST /query| API["FastAPI backend"]
    API --> Router["Deterministic routing"]
    Router --> Retrieval["Retrieval and evidence checks"]
    Corpus["Local curated corpus"] --> Retrieval
    Router --> Insufficient["Insufficient-evidence response"]
    Retrieval -->|Accepted evidence| Generation["Response generation"]
    Retrieval -->|Insufficient evidence| Insufficient
    Generation -. Optional .-> LivAI["LivAI via PydanticAI"]
    Generation -. Optional .-> Argo["Argo (ANL) gateway"]
    Generation --> Answer["Answer with citations and provenance"]
    Answer --> UI
    Insufficient --> UI
```

For supported documentation questions, the backend:

1. Retrieves and ranks passages from the curated corpus.
2. Applies relevance and coherence checks to select acceptable evidence.
3. Generates a response using the deterministic generator or an optional LLM provider (LivAI or Argo).
4. Returns the answer with citations, provenance, and route/debug metadata.

Unsupported questions or questions without adequate evidence receive an explicit insufficient-evidence response.

The default `lexical` mode does not initialize or download an embedding model. Optional `semantic` mode uses dense embeddings; `hybrid` mode combines lexical and semantic relevance.

Ingestion runs separately from queries: source records are normalized, chunked, and stored for retrieval, with embeddings handled through an abstraction. The application does not fetch documentation at request time.

See [Architecture](docs/dev/architecture.md) for routing, ingestion, retrieval scoring, and evidence thresholds.

## Limitations

- The corpus is small and may not reflect current E3SM documentation. Answer quality depends on coverage, chunking, and retrieval configuration.
- Web and operational connectors are extension points without bundled live production implementations.
- Authentication, access control, and persistent conversation history are not implemented.
- Optional LivAI requires a backend-only API key; optional Argo requires an ANL username and the ANL network. Never place secrets in the frontend or commit them. See [Developer setup](docs/dev/setup.md).
