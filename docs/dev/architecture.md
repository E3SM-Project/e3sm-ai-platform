# Architecture

The current repository is a minimal vertical slice for E3SM Compass. It favors
deterministic, provider-independent boundaries over a larger application
framework.

## Repository layout

- `backend/`: FastAPI service package `e3sm_ai_platform`.
- `frontend/`: React, TypeScript, and Vite chat UI.
- `evaluation/`: independent deterministic pytest integration evaluation.
- `docs/`: canonical guides, status, roadmap, and historical prompt.

The root Python workspace includes `backend` and `evaluation`. The frontend is a
separate npm package.

## Backend flow

`POST /query` is implemented by the FastAPI app in `e3sm_ai_platform.api.app`. The
application service wires these stages:

1. Load the bundled static curated corpus JSON.
2. Chunk entries deterministically while preserving citation metadata.
3. Retrieve lexical, semantic, or hybrid candidates with an in-memory store.
4. Filter accepted curated evidence separately from raw candidates.
5. Select a deterministic route.
6. Generate either an evidence-constrained answer or an explicit
   insufficient-evidence response.

`GET /health` returns service status, corpus summary information, and chunk
count.

## Corpus and retrieval

The bundled corpus currently contains 31 curated official-source records covering
the E3SM User Guide, Running E3SM, EAM, EAMxx, ELM, E3SM Diagnostics, and
E3SM-Unified. Each record retains source ID, title, URL, section, component,
version, authority, provenance, and text.

Retrieval defaults to deterministic, local lexical term-frequency vectors. This
offline-safe mode does not initialize or download an embedding model. Its
scoring, metadata bonuses, phrase bonuses, and acceptance policy require
meaningful query coverage, score, and official authority. A deterministic
LlamaIndex-backed lexical store also exists as an optional in-memory
implementation.

Set `RETRIEVAL_MODE` to `semantic` or `hybrid` to enable dense
retrieval through `llama-index-embeddings-huggingface`. The service constructs
the configured `EMBEDDING_MODEL` only in those modes; it defaults to
`BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`. The model is downloaded by Hugging Face on its first
use unless already cached. Tests inject a `SemanticEmbedder` rather than loading
a model.

Raw candidate evidence may appear in debug metadata for gap responses, but it is
labeled unverified and is not returned as accepted evidence or citations.

## Candidate ranking and evidence acceptance

The default `InMemoryVectorStore` retrieves up to `max(top_k, 8)` candidates,
sorts them by descending score, and uses `chunk_id` to break score ties
deterministically. `top_k` defaults to 4. Semantic and hybrid modes retain the
same tie-breaker and source metadata.

Each candidate score is composed of:

```text
cosine similarity
+ (query-term coverage x 0.45)
+ metadata matches (0.035 each)
+ targeted phrase bonuses
```

Query-term coverage is the share of normalized, expanded query terms found in a
candidate's source ID, title, section, component, or text. Normalization removes
common stopwords, and a small synonym map expands related terms such as
`compset` and `compsets`.

A candidate is accepted as curated evidence only when it has official authority,
coverage of at least `0.18`, and a score of at least `0.11`. Requests matching
unsupported-intent phrases accept no evidence. To keep an answer coherent, an
accepted candidate must share a matched term with the top accepted candidate,
unless it has coverage of at least `0.34`. The final accepted set is capped at
the requested `top_k`.

Semantic mode ranks by dense cosine similarity. It can accept an official
paraphrase with low lexical coverage only when `semantic_score` meets
`RETRIEVAL_SEMANTIC_MIN_SCORE` (default `0.7`). Hybrid mode computes
the deterministic weighted average below, where lexical relevance is the
lexical score clamped to `[0, 1]` and semantic relevance is cosine similarity
clamped at zero:

```text
hybrid_score = (
  lexical_weight * clamp(lexical_score, 0, 1)
  + semantic_weight * max(semantic_score, 0)
) / (lexical_weight + semantic_weight)
```

The weights default to `0.5` each and are configured with
`RETRIEVAL_LEXICAL_WEIGHT` and `RETRIEVAL_SEMANTIC_WEIGHT`. Hybrid acceptance permits either the
existing lexical gate or the calibrated semantic threshold, but never bypasses
official authority, unsupported-intent rejection, citation provenance, or
explicit insufficient-evidence behavior. The lexical thresholds remain
configurable as `RETRIEVAL_LEXICAL_MIN_COVERAGE` and
`RETRIEVAL_LEXICAL_MIN_SCORE`.

The router selects the `curated` path only when accepted evidence exists and its
top score is at least `0.12`. Otherwise, routing rules may select an explicit
insufficient-evidence, web, or future operational path.

### Evidence metadata and score display

Every evidence record includes `retrieval_mode`, `score`, `lexical_score`,
`semantic_score`, and `coverage` where applicable. Scores are relevance values,
not probabilities or confidence percentages. The frontend displays the primary
value as a retrieval score and labels `coverage * 100` as lexical coverage; for
example, 67% coverage means that two-thirds of the normalized query terms appear
in the evidence.

## Routing and generation

The exposed route values are:

- `curated`: accepted curated evidence supports the answer.
- `web`: the question appears to require current web information.
- `future_operational`: the question appears to require live operational,
  GitHub, SimBoard, scheduler, or tool data.
- `insufficient_evidence`: no accepted curated evidence is available, or the
  query is unsupported.

The prototype does not include a live web-search provider or live operational
connector. Those routes currently produce explicit insufficient-evidence
messages.

Generation is deterministic by default and cites only accepted curated evidence.
Optional LivAI, Argo, or local Ollama generation can be enabled for curated-evidence answers with
backend-only environment variables; provider errors fall back to deterministic
generation.

`application/service.py` extends the existing provider selection with
`integrations/ollama.py`. Ollama uses the existing Pydantic AI/OpenAI-compatible
stack, preserves deterministic response metadata, and replaces only the answer
on success. Other routes and absent accepted evidence bypass generation.
LivAI and Argo behavior and debug fields remain unchanged.

Ollama accepts loopback endpoints only, disables proxies/redirects and retries,
and applies a total asynchronous provider deadline. A nonblocking process-wide
lock allows one active generation; busy requests fall back immediately. Use one
backend worker for the laptop deployment. Cancellation closes the client request
but cannot guarantee immediate server-side cancellation.

The prompt budget counts UTF-8 bytes conservatively for the baseline tokenizers,
reserving output and 512 chat-template tokens. It retains complete evidence
chunks in order and falls back if none fit. Operators must configure the actual
Ollama model context through a Modelfile; the OpenAI-compatible API cannot set it
per request. Custom tokenizers/templates require validation. See
[setup](setup.md#local-ollama-inference) for model approval, runtime limits, laptop
comparison, rollback, and the separately scoped future NERSC hosting option.

## API response shape

The canonical response includes:

- `answer`
- `route`
- `route_alias`
- `citations`
- `evidence`
- `retrieved_evidence`
- `insufficient_evidence`
- `debug`

`retrieved_evidence` is the flat evaluation-compatible field. Each record carries
source and provenance data needed to connect evidence to citations.

## Frontend

The frontend is a React/Vite chat UI with question input, answer display,
citations, loading/error states, expandable evidence, and route/source debug
display. In local development, Vite proxies `/query` to the backend unless
`VITE_API_BASE_URL` is configured.

The browser sends W3C `traceparent` headers for query requests and displays the
server-generated `X-Request-ID` in generic error messages when available.

## Extension boundaries

Provider-independent protocols exist for:

- embedders;
- vector stores;
- rerankers;
- hybrid retrievers;
- future web sources;
- future operational/tool sources.

These boundaries are intended to support later pgvector, hybrid retrieval,
reranking, web search, SimBoard, GitHub/API/MCP, and other tool integrations
without changing the deterministic evaluation baseline.

## Current non-goals and gaps

The current prototype does not implement authentication, authorization,
persistent conversation history, live web retrieval, live operational tools,
write-capable tools, production telemetry deployment, metrics export, log export
through OpenTelemetry, or production audit logging.
